# SPA (SCAN PageRank)

## Overview

SPA (Structural-clustering PageRank Based Active Learning) is the implementation code for the research paper titled A Structural-Clustering Based Active Learning for Graph Neural Networks". This project focuses on active learning for graph structured data, and is designed to run on Google Colab. Thus, avoiding library conflict for reproduceability

## Key Features

- **Community Detection**: Algorithms for identifying closely knit communities within networked data.
- **Active Learning**: Techniques to improve learning efficiency in graph neural networks.
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Advanced methods for processing graph-structured data.

## Running the Code on Google Colab

Since SPA is designed to run on Google Colab, you do not need to install anything on your local machine. Follow these steps to run the code:

1. Open the SPA notebook in Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code.
